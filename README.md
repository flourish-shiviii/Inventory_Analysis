# Inventory Management Analysis  

This Excel project analyzes inventory data to identify inefficiencies and optimize stock levels. It provides actionable insights to enhance demand forecasting, reduce operational costs, and streamline inventory management processes.  

## Overview  
The main goal of this project was to analyze inventory management data to:  
- Identify overstock and stockout scenarios by understanding inventory discrepancies.  
- Improve demand forecasting across regions and product categories to align inventory with actual sales trends.  
- Enhance operational efficiency by minimizing holding costs and optimizing reordering processes.  
- Support decision-making by equipping stakeholders with data-driven recommendations to improve sales performance and regional stock management.  

## Objective  
This project addresses several challenges in inventory management, including:  
- Overstocking, which increases holding costs and risks wastage.  
- Stockout scenarios, causing missed sales opportunities and customer dissatisfaction.  
- Forecasting inaccuracies, leading to mismatches between inventory and demand.  
- Regional sales volatility, complicating inventory allocation and reordering.  
- Seasonal inventory management, balancing demand during peak and off-peak periods.  
- Operational inefficiencies, misaligning inventory levels with sales trends.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used in this project consists of **7,300 rows and 10 columns**, sourced from an anonymized inventory management database. It represents real-world scenarios across multiple stores and regions.  

**Key attributes include**:  
- Store ID, Product ID, Category  
- Inventory Level, Units Sold, Demand Forecast  
- Weather Conditions, Seasonality Factors  

## Tools and Techniques  
The analysis employed **Pivot Tables**, **Conditional Formatting**, and Excel formulas such as `SUM`, `IF`, and `VLOOKUP` to identify trends and discrepancies. An interactive dashboard was created to consolidate insights, enabling data-driven decision-making.
